## Google Search Analysis Project

Welcome to the Google Search Analysis project! This project involves an in-depth exploration of search engine ranking dynamics, focusing on Google search results. By leveraging Python and data analysis libraries, we examine how websites perform based on their ranks, keyword concentrations, and traffic distribution. This README provides an overview of the project structure, key code snippets, and visualizations.

### Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and understand the factors influencing the performance of websites in Google search results. By conducting analysis on a dataset comprising over 4,000 rows of search results across 100 destinations, 2 keyword variations, and 2 countries, we uncover insights into ranking trends and traffic distribution.

### Key Code Snippets

The project code, implemented using Python and popular data analysis libraries, is divided into distinct sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: The project begins by loading the dataset using the Google Colab environment and performing initial exploratory data analysis. Basic statistics, data information, and missing value analysis are conducted to understand the dataset's structure.

2. **Traffic Estimation and Visualization**: We estimate the percentage of traffic for each Google search result position and visualize the distribution using a bar chart. The visualization provides insights into the relationship between ranking positions and traffic.

3. **Traffic Analysis by Website**: In this section, we focus on specific websites and analyze their share of traffic across various search terms. The top websites are identified based on their contribution to total traffic, and a bar chart illustrates their impact.

4. **Keyword Concentration Analysis**: We delve into the concentration of search terms in titles and snippets of search results. Visualizations showcase the average keyword concentration for different ranking positions, shedding light on optimization strategies.

5. **Traffic Evolution Analysis**: The project explores the evolution of traffic distribution over time. By merging multiple datasets representing different time points, we track how the traffic distribution of top websites changes over months.

### Visualizations

The project employs visualizations to convey meaningful insights:

- Bar charts illustrate the estimated percentage of traffic for each ranking position, highlighting the diminishing share of traffic as positions decrease.

- The contribution of top websites to total traffic is showcased through a bar chart, offering a clear understanding of their impact.

- Heatmaps visualize the average keyword concentration in titles and snippets across various ranking positions, aiding in identifying optimization trends.

- A time-series line plot tracks the evolution of traffic distribution for top websites over multiple months, revealing changes in their performance.

### Conclusion

The Google Search Analysis project offers a comprehensive exploration of search engine ranking dynamics, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing website performance in Google search results. Through data analysis and visualization, we gain a deeper understanding of traffic distribution, keyword optimization, and trends over time.
